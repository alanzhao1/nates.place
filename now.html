    <p>Currently working as a software developer at <a href="https://overleaf.com">Overleaf</a> where I write frontend, backend, do data analysis, go to conferences, go to london to hangout with the team, and have meetings. It's a great gig and it pays well enough. I work remotely (and not just because of the pandemic).</p>
