        Currently breaking from work for about a month before I start classes in
        September. Having fun doing tech stuff on my own, hanging out with
        family (where possible, pandemic is still happening ya know), chatting
        with friends, and cooking some food.

        Currently working as a software developer at
        <a href="https://overleaf.com">Overleaf</a> where I write frontend,
        backend, do data analysis, go to conferences, go to london to hangout
        with the team, and have meetings. It's a great gig and it pays well
        enough. I work remotely (and not just because of the pandemic).
