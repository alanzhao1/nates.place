        Wow, it's been a while since updating here, but I'm not dead! Ever since
        the PhD got cut short, life felt like it has been flying by. Both in
        good, and bad, ways. Things seems to have steadied a bit now, and Diane
        and I moved to Seattle which we are loving. Been staying active and
        learning lots of new quantum things. Work is good, exciting, and busy.
        Encountering lots of new unknowns every day.

        It's wild that it's 2021 and the year seems to be getting worse than
        2020. Anyway, I'm currently entering my second semester of grad school.
        I'll be taking <b>Quantum Info. Devices</b> an
        <b>Open Quantum Systems</b> and maybe <b>Lie Groups/Algebras</b> if I
        decide taking three courses isn't taking too much of my time. I've also
        been writing some poetry recently, and some other creative writing. I'd
        like to share some of it eventually, but not yet. heheh

        Currently breaking from work for about a month before I start classes in
        September. Having fun doing tech stuff on my own, hanging out with
        family (where possible, pandemic is still happening ya know), chatting
        with friends, and cooking some food.

        Currently working as a software developer at
        <a href="https://overleaf.com">Overleaf</a> where I write frontend,
        backend, do data analysis, go to conferences, go to london to hangout
        with the team, and have meetings. It's a great gig and it pays well
        enough. I work remotely (and not just because of the pandemic).
