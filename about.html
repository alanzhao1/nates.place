    <h2>about nate</h2>
    <p>
      Hey, I'm Nate and I use he/they pronouns. I'm currently a Member of Technical Staff at Unitary Fund where I work on <a href="https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq">Mitiq</a>.
      Before this I completed a masters degree at the University of Waterloo where I studied error mitigation and quantum circuit compilation with Professor Joel Wallman.
      Before that, I was a software developer at <a href="https://overleaf.com">Overleaf</a>, and before that I did my undergraduate in mathematics and physics at New York University.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of the time I give to work in order to survive I like to use tech to make me <em>happy</em> and less reliant on <b>malevolent</b> companies.
      For me, this has ranged from small things like using different search engines, to removing accounts and finding providers for tools I need that have (sometimes only marginally) better privacy practices.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      I also very much enjoy rock climbing, riding bikes, literature, and increasingly poetry.
      I enjoy most forms of art, and have been experimenting in many forms as of late.
      Perhaps I'll muster the courage to post some eventually.
