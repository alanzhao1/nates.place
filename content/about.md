# `whoami`

Hey, I'm nate and I use he/they pronouns.
I work as a Member of Technical Staff at [Unitary Foundation](https://unitary.foundation/) where I lead development on our toolkit for applying Quantum Error Mitigation protocols: [`mitiq`](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq).

Before this I completed a masters degree (coursework <a href="coursework/index.html">here</a>) at the Instite for Quantum Computing where I worked on quantum circuit compilation with Joel Wallman.
Before that, I was a software developer at [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com), and before that I did my undergraduate in mathematics and physics at New York University.

In my spare time I enjoy staying active (rock climbing, running, and riding bikes), fostering relationships with loved ones, and trying to [slow down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_movement_(culture)).
